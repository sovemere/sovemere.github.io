I don't know much about happiness apart from what everyone knows, that it is a very precious thing and that one never has enough of it. Much ruin is made in lives every day wringing ersatz happiness out of rags that ought to be left untouched. On one autumn morning I had felt my supply run dry mid-walk through the alleyways of my city when, passing once by a particular pub that is always packed to bursting, I found myself briefly cast into some kind of purgatory. *Eat drink and be merry*. The line played in my head again and again, an imp doing a flute jig, again and again, and each time it left me a little sorer.
